# FastEnum
FastEnum is **the fastest** enum utilities for C#/.NET. It's much faster than .NET Core, and also faster than [Enums.NET](https://github.com/TylerBrinkley/Enums.NET) that is similar library. Provided methods are all achieved **zero allocation** and are designed easy to use like `System.Enum`. This library is quite useful to significantly improve your performance because enum is really popular feature.

# How to use

This library super easy to use like `System.Enum` that is standard of .NET. Look below:

```cs
//--- FastEnum
var values = FastEnum.GetValues<Fruits>();
var names = FastEnum.GetNames<Fruits>();
var name = FastEnum.GetName<Fruits>(Fruits.Apple);
var name = Fruits.Apple.ToName();
var defined = FastEnum.IsDefined<Fruits>(123);
var parse = FastEnum.Parse<Fruits>("Apple");
var tryParse = FastEnum.TryParse<Fruits>("Apple", out var value);
```

```cs
//--- .NET
var values = Enum.GetValues(typeof(Fruits)) as Fruits[];
var names = Enum.GetNames(typeof(Fruits));
var name = Enum.GetName(typeof(Fruits), Fruits.Apple);
var name = Fruits.Apple.ToString();
var defined = Enum.IsDefined(typeof(Fruits), 123);
var parse = Enum.Parse<Fruits>("Apple");
var tryParse = Enum.TryParse<Fruits>("Apple", out var value);
```

As you can see, the replacement from `System.Enum` is very easy. You never confuse.



# More features

There are some functions that are often used for enum, and you can be used more conveniently by including them together.


## 1. Gets pairwised member information

Sometimes you want name / value pair of enum. `Member<TEnum>` can be used under such cases. Of course supports [deconstruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/deconstruct) feature. `FieldInfo` is also included, so please use it for reflection code.


```cs
class Member<TEnum>
{
    public TEnum Value { get; }
    public string Name { get; }
    public FieldInfo FieldInfo { get; }
    // etc...
}

var member = Fruits.Apple.ToMember();
var (name, value) = member;  // Supports deconstruction
```


## 2. Gets `EnumMemberAttribute.Value`

I often see the developer using `EnumMemberAttribute` as an alias for field name. So FastEnum provides an API that the value can be quickly obtained from the `EnumMemberAttribute.Value` property.


```cs
enum Company
{
    [EnumMember(Value = "Apple, Inc.")]
    Apple = 0,
}

var value = Company.Apple.GetEnumMemberValue();  // Apple, Inc.
```



## 3. Adds multiple label annotations to a field

Multiple attributes can’t be attached to the same field, since `EnumMemberAttribute` is specified `AllowMultiple = false`. It’s inconvenient and I don’t like it personally, so I often use my own `LabelAttribute` as an alternative. You can use it conveniently as follows, because FastEnum provides this feature.


```cs
enum Company
{
    [Label("Apple, Inc.")]
    [Label("AAPL", 1)]
    Apple = 0,
}

var x1 = Company.Apple.GetLabel();   // Apple, Inc.
var x2 = Company.Apple.GetLabel(1);  // AAPL
```


# Limitation

## 1. Provides only generics API
FastEnum provides only generics version method because of performance reason. `System.Enum` provides `System.Type` argument overload, but that’s too slow because of boxing occuration. If you need to use the method that passes `System.Type` type, please use `System.Enum` version.



## 2. Can’t parse comma-separated string
`System.Enum.Parse` can parse like following string. I think that it isn’t well known because it is a specification that exists quietly.


```cs
//--- Assuming there is an enum type like following...
[Flags]
enum Fruits
{
    Apple = 1,
    Lemon = 2,
    Melon = 4,
    Banana = 8,
}

//--- Passes comma-separated string
var value = Enum.Parse<Fruits>("Apple, Melon");
Console.WriteLine((int)value);  // 5
```

It seems to be a useful function when performing flag processing, but if tries to add such a comma-separated analysis, the overhead will come out, so cutting this feature off makes speed up. I think that in most cases there is no problem, because this feature is rarely used (at least I have NEVER used for 12 years).



# Why fast ?

As you might expect, it’s because cached internally. It takes the approach of **Static Type Caching**, so the reading cost is **almost zero**. Based on this, I use techniques for avoiding allocation, and create specialized dictionary for specific key internally.
